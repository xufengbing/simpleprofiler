1. install this plug-in in the development environment and add this into target
(if the target is not the runtime one.)

later, we need to split this plug-in into 2 , one for instrumentation, one for display
result. the model can be put in display result one.

2. under the used jre, create a dir named "classes"
ex:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_22\jre\classes
and put the class file or model into it.
