*How To Solve "management agent is not enabled" Problem for JConsole

JConsole from JDK 6 supports dynamic attach capability, this means it is able to attach any running Java application which does not need to start with -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote option. However, you may not able to attach a running Java process because of "The management agent is not enabled on this process" error. To solve this, just create a new temporary directory (e.g. C:\tmp) and points your TMP environment to there. (Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables). Restart your Java application and now your JConsole should be able to attach it now. For more troubleshooting tip, you may read Daniel Fuchs Blogs and Sun Forum.
