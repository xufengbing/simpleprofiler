
How to push changes from one step to later steps:

You make a change in step 3, for example.
- commit the changes in step 3, note the revisions. You need them 3 lines below.
- update all later steps (not sure, but to be safe)
- run the launch config called "promote from step-03"
  It asks for the start revision where merging should begin. It's usually one of the latest revisions.
    If you use a revision that is too old, you might get obsolete changes back
  This will merge the changes from step 3 into all steps >3
  Watch the SVN console for conflicts, you need to merge them manually
- commit all steps >3
